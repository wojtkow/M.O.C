# M.O.C
 __M.O.C - My Open Caching client written in Swift__ 

This is a private client for polish open caching site http://www.opencaching.pl.
There is no plan to publish it in App Store because of Google pricing policy about maps. Simply - Google Maps are to expensive to expect any return from app.

But - you can download project, set own API keys for OpenCaching and Google Maps services and build it for own devices.


## Requirements

- iOS 11.4
- Xcode 10.2+
- Swift 5

## Important dependencies

- Alamofire
- Google Maps

## Basic concepts
- Dependecy Injection
- Flow Controllers
